# Computer Architecture Lab

This lab deals with coding in MIPS Assembly

All coded individually by me.

	Lab 1: High level-to-low level language conversion

	Lab 2: Control Flow (including loops and branches), Inputs and Outputs

	Lab 3: Arithmetic Operations (Basic and float) and Combinatorial Logic

	Lab 4: CPU Structure, Pipeline Programming and Hazards, Exceptions and Interrupts

	Lab 5: Simulating a Cache
